# Clean-Blog for Pico
A clean, Bootstrap blog theme designed by [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/clean-blog/) and ported to Pico by BesrourMS and janskapa.

## Installation
Download the repo folder, upload it in the themes folder of your Pico installation and change the following setting within your config.yml:
```sh
 theme: clean-blog
 pages_order_by: date
 pages_order: desc
```

DEPRACATED: You must add these custom settings in your config file 
```sh
$config['author'] = 'Your Name';
$config['facebook'] = 'https://www.facebook.com/YourPage';
$config['twitter'] = '@username';

For the pagination the theme uses [Pico Pagination Plugin](https://github.com/rewdy/Pico-Pagination) so you must install this plugin.
